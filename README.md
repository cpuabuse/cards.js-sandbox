# About

Card.js is a tool for learning - primarily languages.

**Technologies and standards**

* Node.js
* YAML
* MySQL
* Nunjucks

## Goals

* Learn JS and Node.js
* Use this as a portfolio
* Use this tool to learn languages

## As a file

A file designated to be/contain an entrypoint to the system. It eventually will be able to possibly take some command line arguments. Based on the results of the system initialization, the cards.js may pass different parameters to the server.
