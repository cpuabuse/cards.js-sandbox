# cards.js/apps

Even though called "apps", this is a default container for the ServerController settings.

By design, the apps are to be seen as children of the ServerController, thus by default they are included into the subfolders within the "apps" folder. Eventually the initialization routine of the ServerController will allow for automatic loading of the Apps within.
